Genome partitioning is controlled by proteins that usually reside on highly repetitive DNA at a single locus on each chromosome. The work proposed here promises to advance our knowledge of how this critical process is performed without error in healthy cells and which molecules may be to blame when catastrophic loss or gain of a chromosome occurs in disease.","BLACK, BEN E.;","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M",07/01/2008,04/30/2019,"Address; Adult; Aneuploidy; Area; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; biophysical analysis; Biophysics; Cell Cycle; Cell division; Cells; Centromere; centromere autoantigen 80K; centromere protein A; centromere protein C; Chromatin; Chromatin Modeling; chromosomal location; Chromosome Segregation; Chromosomes; Chromosomes, Artificial, Human; Complex; Congenital Abnormality; Coupled; Data; daughter cell; Defect; Dependence; design; Deuterium; Digestion; Disease; DNA; DNA Binding; DNA Sequence; Down Syndrome; embryo/fetus; Ensure; Epigenetic Process; Equilibrium; Eukaryota; Evolution; experimental study; Female; Funding; Gene Dosage; Generations; Genetic; Genome; Genomics; Germ Cells; Heritability; Histone H3; Histones; Human; Human Biology; Hydrogen; Immobilization; improved; insight; Investigation; Knowledge; Location; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; Meiosis; Micrococcal Nuclease; Microtubules; Mitotic spindle; Molecular; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Nature; Newborn Infant; Nucleosomes; Pattern; Population; Positioning Attribute; Process; Proteins; Proteomics; reconstitution; recruit; Regulation; Role; Satellite DNA; Sequence-Specific DNA Binding Protein; Specific qualifier value; Spontaneous abortion; Stretching; structural genomics; Surface; synthetic biology; Testing; Time; tumor; Variant; Work; ",Centromere Identity and Function,82989.0,MGB,Molecular Genetics B Study Section ,11.0,326433.0,,NON-SBIR/STTR RPGS,204800.0,121633.0,6463801.0,0

This project investigates the basic principles and significance of light-dependent intracellular movements of a heterotrimeric G protein in photoreceptor rods. The proposed experiments will determine how the ability of the G protein to relocalize is important for light adaptation and long-term photoreceptor cells. The new insights are important for understanding currently incurable blinding diseases, and is also important for broader aspects of neuronal degeneration.","SLEPAK, VLADLEN Z;","NEUHOLD, LISA ",5/1/2009,4/30/2015,Active Biological Transport; Afferent Neurons; Affinity; alpha Subunit Transducin; Animals; Arrestins; base; Binding; Biochemical; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Cyclic GMP; Cytoprotection; Darkness; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Dependence; design; Diffusion; Disease; Dissociation; Distal; DNA Sequence Rearrangement; Drosophila genus; Electroretinography; Employee Strikes; Enzymes; Event; Eye; Future; Gated Ion Channel; Gene Transfer; Genetic; Goals; GRK1 gene; GTP-Binding Proteins; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Guanosine Triphosphate; Guanylate Cyclase; Health; Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Hydrolysis; In Situ; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Investigation; Knowledge; Laboratories; Left; Light; Light Adaptations; Light Cell; light intensity; Lighting; Longitudinal Studies; Mammalian Cell; Mediating; Membrane; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Motors; mouse model; Movement; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; Noise; Nuclear; Pathway interactions; Phagocytosis; phosphoric diester hydrolase; Phosphorylation; Photons; Photoreceptors; Phototransduction; Physiological; Physiology; polarized cell; Presynaptic Terminals; prevent; Process; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Recovery; Research; Research Personnel; research study; response; Rest; restoration; Retinal; Retinal Degeneration; retinal rods; Rhodopsin; rhodopsin kinase; Rod Outer Segments; Role; Scientist; Series; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; Stimulus; Structure of retinal pigment epithelium; Subfamily lentivirinae; Testing; Transducin; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Translating; Vertebrate Photoreceptors; Vision; Vision research; Work; ,Light-dependent Transducin Movement in Retinal Rods.,18666.0,BDPE,Biology and Diseases of the Posterior Eye Study Section ,5.0,343170.0,,Non-SBIR/STTR RPGs,225720.0,117450.0,,0

Project 1: Antibody Responses to HCV Vaccine Antigens in Infection and Vaccination     Project Leader (PL): Law, M.          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): HCV infects nearly 3% of the world population and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. A vaccine that can stop virus transmission will be a highly valuable tool for the public health system. However, HCV is antigenically variable and an effective vaccine must target conserved immune epitopes on the virus. An important goal in HCV vaccine is to develop antigens that will elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The proposed project aims to discover the epitopes targeted by bNAbs during vaccination and natural infection, and the evolutionary pathways of bnAbs.

Virus neutralizing antibodies play an important part in HCV protection and this proposed Cooperative Center aims to elucidate the scientific paths for the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibody responses in humans and preclinical animal models by vaccination.          Project 1: Antibody Responses to HCV Vaccine Antigens in Infection and Vaccination     Project Leader (PL): Law, M.          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): HCV infects nearly 3% of the world population and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. A vaccine that can stop virus transmission will be a highly valuable tool for the public health system. However, HCV is antigenically variable and an effective vaccine must target conserved immune epitopes on the virus. An important goal in HCV vaccine is to develop antigens that will elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The proposed project aims to discover the epitopes targeted by bNAbs during vaccination and natural infection, and the evolutionary pathways of bnAbs. The knowledge learned from the human studies will be applied to studying the antibody responses in mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates immunized with candidate HCV vaccine antigens. The research will help uncover the pros and cons of each animal model as a preclinical model for efficacy study of future HCV vaccine candidates. This project will contribute to the knowledge and tools for the development of a broadly effective HCV vaccine.
